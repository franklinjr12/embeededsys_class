# embeededsys_class

This repository is for the embeeded systems class of my university course. Final assingment was to control a virtual car inside a round track through USB connection from the PC to the board which translates to UART.
Used the IAR IDE and Tiva TM4C1294 board wich has a cortex m4 processor.

Main code relies on [firmware code](projeto_final/board_version/tarefas/src/tarefas.c)

Also made a PC version for testing [PC code](projeto_final/pc_version/main.cpp)
